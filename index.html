  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This research presents the design, development, and innovation analysis of an Arduino-driven agricultural robot capable of real-time soil and climate analysis, seed suggestion, and automatic dispensing of varied seeds. A review of existing open-source, academic, and commercial systems demonstrates significant limitations in autonomous seed selection, which this project addresses by integrating multiple sensors and intelligent control.

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Automation in seed sowing has rapidly evolved, yet most solutions focus primarily on mechanical dispensing and basic obstacle avoidance. In contrast, smart farming requires data-driven decision-making—selecting the most suitable crop for real-time local conditions. This project aims to push the boundaries by enabling a robot to analyze soil/colour, moisture, and climate, and autonomously select, sow, and irrigate the best-matched seed from a collection.

  <h2>2. Review of Existing Systems</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Open-source & Academic:</b> Most robots (KSCST, TechPacs, Instructables, IJARIIE, IJNRD) combine Arduino/embedded control, DC motors, IR/ultrasonic sensors, and offer basic automated sowing, obstacle avoidance, and simple irrigation. Soil sensing is basic to moderate, seldom linked to crop selection.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Commercial:</b> Commercial “seed sowing robots” similarly focus on fixed-seed dispensing and do not feature real-time crop recommendation or multi-bin seed selection.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>All evaluated systems lack intelligent, sensor-based seed selection. Their limitations are summarized below:</p>
